### 🔬Research Interest
---
- ***Explanation Map for Convolutional Neural Nets***
    - It's always interesting to see how and where CNNs look at the input image to do their work. I am doing research about methodology of how to extract what models see. Starting from traditional Grad-CAM, SmoothGrad and now working on SCOUTER and trying to come up with new methods.
- ***Neuroimaging with Deep Learning***
    - Decoding Neural activations with fMRI data. Current fMRI analyzing data relies on statistical models and I anticipate that the deep learning model would be a novel approach to this. Since neuroscience, neuroimaging nourished deep learning fields in many ways, I think this would help oppositely too. Some people already took their step to this and very thankful for what they've done and trying to continue their work.

- ***Neuroscience***
    - Interested in finding the basis of emotions and personality. Theories such as Big5 or MBTIs can well explain personality but it is biased with a self-prediction error. Trying to come up with emotional models like two-dimensional models of emotions — valence and arousals — which is quite explainable and mapping them into mathematics makes sense to me. Also finding their neural substrates would be an awesome job.
